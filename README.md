# Software_Engineering_Scheduling_Algorithm
This is a repository dedicated to our work for Software Engineering at Whitworth University


Goals:

By Friday March 16, 2018 have the C++ code for CSV file format parsing complete
as well as C++ code to read in a file from an Excel Spreadsheet in CSV format. 

Extended Deliverable Time line: 

Project has been created on Github,
Need to write input/output for Excel Documents
Potentially utilize MS Office API
Write Sorting Algorithm


Rules for Code:

Please Make all function definitions in a header file

Naming should be as follows: Capital....._Capital.....
	Example is Application_Main.cpp
Function and Method names should follow the same naming convention. 

Implementation for functions should be in .cpp files


PLEASE KEEP MAIN CLEAN AND NEAT!

Please comment code for general usage.

For example: 
*/ Function reads file in from Excel */

Please do not leave any errors or exceptions uncommented or unfixed in code when merging or pushing to master.

Please check GitHub regularly.


Objectives:
	Create File Read and Write
	Create Sorting Algorithm
	Create parameters for consideration for sorting
